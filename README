Description
-------
mdb-lookup-server-nc-2.c will do the following:

- It has a loop in which it displays a prompt, "port number: ".  It
  reads the port number typed in by the user and then fork/exec the
  mdb-lookup-server-nc.sh script using that port number.  It also prints out a
  message stating that an instance of mdb-lookup-server has started.
  The message includes the child's process ID and the port
  number on which it's listening.

- Hitting ENTER on the prompt should simply display another prompt.

- On every iteration, before it displays a prompt, the program checks if
  any of the child processes have terminated.  It displays the
  process IDs of all terminated mdb-lookup-server processes along with
  messages saying that they have terminated.
